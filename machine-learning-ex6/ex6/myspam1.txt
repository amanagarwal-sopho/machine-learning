 When we enter the hospital for our 5-year-old son’s blood transfusions, he cries at the peak of his voice. He knows a painful injection is waiting for him. At the hospital, everyone looks at him when he cries aloud. We have to hold him tight before the nurse pricks him with a needle. I helplessly see him cry in this situation. He has been suffering from Thalassemia since birth. The only way out to save his life is a bone marrow transplant costing a whopping Rs. 20 lakh. I’m unable to afford such an expensive amount. We’re not that well-off.

Our son does not have any friends. He has never played outside our home because we don’t allow him. His situation has tied me to treat him like this, not me. For our son, the travel to get his blood transfusions is hell. Once he’s due, he would already be tried and irritated. We have to travel 30 km far from our village by partly walking, taking a rickshaw, a bus and then a train. He suffers in the crowded train the most. I wish I was able to give him some comfort as a father, however, I’m failing.
